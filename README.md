# TeleportationWarsShipRefactor


TODO:
- tfiles need a fairly complex system but the current system adds a variant name to each entry; if anyone has a good solution we would appreciate it
- primary purpose "mine" should be hooked up to its own purpose if (it shares values with trade at the moment)
- test a "release" mode build 
- go over the rules expressed in Config.toml
- test variant false

#TODO
# - write an explanantion of the physics properties
# - determinism for people, hangarcapacity, ammo

# while it is possible to add production cost, 
# the effects would have to be seriously considered 
# and not the result of some random function

# no decimals! 
# (a..b) * purposemod of shiptype 

# this is largely irrelevant to what numbers you might select 
# but I wrote the note to us here and here it stays:
 
# the result of a range will be refered to as n
# cargo, hull, mass, are first order values. 
# these values use purposemod to modify which one 
# starts the chain of calculation
# first order values return n. 
# n > average sets the average of the next calculation 
# as the max of the next range. 
# n < average sets the average of the next calculation 
# as the min of the next range. 
# !!! note: mass has an inverse relationship to the other first order values 
# so reverse the logic above for mass 

# trade_purposemod example:
# cargo = n
# mass = n inversely bounded by the result of cargo n 
# hull = n is ALSO inversely bounded by the result of mass
# second order stuff like: unit, ammo, explosion 
# follow the same order for all purpose/class.
